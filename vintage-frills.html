    <main>
        <p>When Black millennial woman Jennifer Kelly left her position as operations coordinator at Tiffany &amp; Co. in
            December 2019, she did not know that less than a year later she would be laid off from Uber via email during
            the COVID-19 pandemic. What could have been an ending was a beginning.</p>

        <p>"I really think it was a sign," Kelly said, reflecting on the April 2020 layoff that ended her brief Uber
            corporate chapter. "The universe was telling me: this isn't your forever home."</p>

        <p>After years climbing the luxury retail ladder --- from CHANEL to GUCCI to Tiffany --- Kelly realized she wanted to
            build something of her own: a business that reflected her creativity, love for fashion and desire for
            work-life balance.</p>

        <p>During quarantine, she began drafting a business plan that became Vintage Frills, a pastel-colored vintage shop
            that opened in 2021 on Milwaukee Avenue of Logan Square.</p>

        <p>(What started as an idea in Kelly's mind grew into an award-winning storefront, recognized by Chicago Magazine
            as the city's Best New Retro Shop in 2022. Kelly's store now anchors a once-empty stretch of Logan Square,
            offering not just vintage fashion, but an experience that blends nostalgia, sustainability and community
            spirit.)</p>


        <p>She started the idea with a pink school bus boutique called The Vintage Fleet in 2020. "I was scared to take a
            true leap," she said. "The bus was my way of cheating." The bus was affordable for Kelly during a slow market,
            letting her test her concept without the full financial risk of a storefront, and it sparked curiosity.</p>

        <p>Kelly remembers it as a pivot point. She scouted estate sales, filled her basement with finds and treated
            sourcing like a mission. She once "literally bought out the entire estate," recalling one haul that supplied
            gowns and jewelry from across decades. The severance she received from Uber provided the runway to pay first
            and last month's rent when a permanent space became available.</p>

        <p>"Vintage is luxury in its own way," Kelly said. "So when I'm picking out things, I make sure the pieces I have in
            store represent that luxury, but also budget-friendly, not outlandish so even a college student can afford ---
            you feel involved. My goal is to continue to educate and show quality garments."</p>

        <p>When Kelly moved in, Milwaukee was nearly empty. Vacant storefronts lined the street, and few shoppers passed
            by. But she was soon welcomed by nearby minority business owners like Hispanic co-founder of Monarch Thrift
            Shop Mireya Fouche, who offered guidance and encouragement. That early sense of community stayed with her.</p>

        <p>Today, Kelly serves as vice president of the Logan Square Chamber of Commerce, helping support other local
            entrepreneurs while keeping her store involved in neighborhood events.</p>

        <p>"Vintage Frills is amazing," said Nilda Esparza, the chamber's executive director. "They're very creative --- they
            put on some of the most creative fashion shows I've seen. Our thrift stores and our secondhand consignment
            shops are becoming more and more eclectic here in Logan Square."</p>

        <p>Kelly's team regularly stages themed fashion shows --- from Sex and the City to Harry Potter --- and often
            collaborates with local markets and community events. "Chicago has fashion, too," Kelly said. "I want people to
            see that you don't have to go to New York or L.A. to have fun with style."</p>

        <blockquote>"This is such a great environment, such an amazing concept and project that Jen has created here, all
            this has come from her imagination," said staffer Liam Bermejo, who recently joined after modeling in Kelly's
            Sex and the City-themed fashion show. "She has such an amazing spirit and personality. She's never been sad or
            mad. I try to emulate that in my life entirely."</blockquote>

        <p>At Vintage Frills, Kelly has built not just a store but an experience. Each cubby in the shop is color-coded and
            designed as a mini world of its own --- lavender rooms filled with vintage blouses, sunshine-yellow corners
            stacked with retro handbags. Kelly designed every display herself and even trademarked the color-coordinated
            layout.</p>

        <p>Brittany Weber, a millennial customer who has visited Vintage Frills several times, said she bought a few
            different guest wedding dresses. One of her favorite finds was a coral pink satin dress from the 1960s,
            long-sleeved and elegant, while another was a green cotton gown from the 1970s decorated with crocheted
            flowers.</p>

        <p>"They have a good variety of clothes, and I like their location and the prices are pretty good," Weber said. "I've
            had a very positive experience every time I've been here."</p>
